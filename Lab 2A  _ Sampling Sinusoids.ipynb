    "## Lab session 2A : Discrete-time sinusoids \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital one\\-dimensional signals most often result from the sampling of an analog signal x\\(t\\) using an Analog\\-to\\-Digital converter, or from the analytical expression of a continuous function x\\(t\\). In both cases, the tranformation from continuous time t to discrete time realizes $x[n]=x(nT_s)$ with a **sampling frequency** $f_s=\\frac{1}{T_s}$, which is generally constant for a given signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "While analog signals take any real values at any time on their domains, digital signals \\(see Tervo, p.58\\) are both of discrete time and of discrete values. This double discretization is mandatory if we want to handle signals using computers, which obviously have finite memory amount. In these lab sessions, we will often **use digital signals to represent analog signals**. As an example, the figures below show a discrete\\-time sinusoid $x[n]=x(nT_s) = A cos(2\\pi f_0 n T_s)$ and the corresponding continuous\\-time signal $x(t) = A cos(2 \\pi f_0 t)$ it should represent : \n",
    "\n",
    "![Discrete sinusoids](https://amubox.univ-amu.fr/s/wpe5PtQziqj8BCT/preview)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this association seems natural and obvious in this example, weirder behaviors are frequently obtained which can't be explained without better knowledge of the time sampling process. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In particular :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A discrete sinusoid, usually considered as $x[n]=A\\cos (2\\pi f_0 nT_s)$ does not always look like a continuous sinusoid \\(see the upper right graph above\\), although they are totally legitimate to represent an actual analog sinusoid. \n",
    "2. The same suite of samples extracted from an analog sinusoid may be obtained for several values of $f_0$, which will accordingly rather be considered as a  \"frequency parameter\". In other words, unlike the analog \"usual\" sinusoid, there is no one\\-to\\-one correspondence between the frequency parameter $f_0$ and a given discrete sinusoid, except if the frequency parameter $f_0$ is constrained in a particular interval \\(_e.g._ $[0 ; f_s]$ or $[-\\frac{f_s}{2} ; \\frac{f_s}{2}]$\\).\n",
    "3. It follows from the previous point that discrete sinusoids \"extracted\" from an analog sinusoidal signal $x(t)$ do not always show the same \"apparent frequency\" that the natural frequency $f_0$ of $x(t)$. For adequately sampled sinusoids \\(_i.e._ for sufficiently fast sampling\\) this apparent frequency is bound to a maximum value of $f_0 = \\frac{f_s}{2}$. Any sampling made at $f_s \\lt 2  f_0$ will result in an apparent frequency lower than $f_0$ ; these sinusoids are called \"undersampled\".\n",
    "4. Discrete sinusoids \"extracted\" from an analog sinusoidal signal should be sampled with a sampling period which is at least two times smaller than the natural period $T_0=\\frac{1} {f_0}$ of the analog sinusoid as $T_0=\\frac{2}{f_s}$ because $f_0=\\frac{f_s}{2}$ and as we know $T_s=\\frac{1}{f_s}$ that means $T_0=2T_s$, $T_s=\\frac{T_0}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Point 1 raises a question : How do we know that a discrete sinusoid, even if looking weird, is actually \"legitimate\" to represent an analog sinusoid of frequency $ f_0 $. By this, we mean that if the discrete sinusoid is converted back to a continuous signal, we obtain the right analog sinusoid with the same frequency $ f_0 $. In other words (see [The sampling theorem](http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/2.htm) in *dspguide.com*) : \n",
    "\n",
    "> If you can exactly *reconstruct* the analog signal from the samples, you must have done the sampling *properly*.  Even if the sampled data appears confusing or incomplete, the key information has been captured if you can reverse the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines the proper sampling of an analog sinusoidal signal, formalized by the famous ***sampling theorem*** or ***Shannon-Nyquist theorem***, a milestone in the field of digital signal processing (DSP). To grasp the full significance of this theorem requires visualizing the sampling process in the frequency domain. In this lab session, you will discover a part of the meaning and practical consequences of this theorem in an empirical but guided way. \n",
    "\n",
    "At any moment before, during and after this lab session, you should read carefully the [above-cited page](http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/2.htm) devoted to the sampling theorem in the *dspguide.com*. At the end of this lab, you should understand more clearly the developments made in this page. \n",

    "#### I.3 \"Bad\" sampling (undersampling) \n",
    "\n",
    "When the Shannon-Nyquist condition is not fulfilled, the analog sinusoid will be undersampled, which means that the apparent frequency $f_{App}$ of the sampled discrete-time sinusoid will not correspond to the actual frequency of the sampled analog sine. \n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete-time sinusoid, or any discrete-time signal, provided it is correctly sampled ($f_s \\geq \\frac{f_{Max}}{2}$) allows to recover the initial anaolg signal, usually through low-pass filtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrary, an undersampled discrete-time sinusoid ($\\nu=(k+\\nu_0)>0.5, k\\in \\mathbb{Z_0} $) will generally not allow to recover the initial signal, but rather a sinusoid corresponding to its principal alias, *i.e.* of an apparent frequency $f_{App}=\\nu_0$. ; this corresponds to a **spectral folding** towards lower frequencies (in french \"*Repliement spectral*\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulator, remember that the background color will shift from white to yellow if the Shannon\\-Nyquist condition is not fulfilled, corresponding to undersampling the analog sinusoid. By checking the button \"_Show principal alias_\", the principal alias will appear in green. In undersampling conditions, the samples do belong to both the analog sinusoid and the principal alias, located at a frequency $f_s - f_0$ when $f_0 \\in [{f_s \\over 2};f_s]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever an analog signal of any shape is sampled, spectral folding may be harmful, because a folded component will appear at a lower frequency, where it can interfere with other components naturally present in the analog signal, which will appear distorted, and not faithful to the original.  \n",
    "\n",
    "in practice, in analog to digital converters working at a fixed sampling frequency $f_s$, the analog input signal is first of all filtered by a low-pass (analog) filter with a cut-off frequency $f_c=\\frac{f_s}{2}$, which will cancel or attenuate the frequencies larger than $\\frac{f_s}{2}$. This low-pass filter, called a guard filter, insures that no spectral component will undergo a spectral folding, thereby keeping the original signal unperturbed in the frequency range up to $\\frac{f_s}{2}$.\n",
